# Video Summarization Project

This project allows users to upload videos or provide video URLs, which are then processed to generate a textual summary. The algorithmic approach involves video preprocessing, feature extraction, temporal summarization, content clustering, summary length control, and summary generation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python (version 3.x)
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-summarization.git

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
### Uploading Videos
Users can upload videos directly through the website. Supported video formats include MP4.

### Providing Video URLs
Alternatively, users can provide video URLs (YouTube links) to generate summaries.

## Algorithmic Approach
The project follows the following algorithmic approach:
1. Video Collection and Preprocessing
2. Shot Boundary Detection
3. Feature Extraction
4. Importance Scoring
5. Temporal Summarization
6. Content Clustering
7. Summary Length Control
8. Summary Generation
9. Text Preprocessing
10. User Interaction

## File Structure
- app/: Contains the Flask web application files.
  - static/: Static files such as CSS and JavaScript.
  - templates/: HTML templates for the web application.
  - routes.py: Handles the application routes.
- requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.
- run.py: Main script to run the Flask application.
